# Retail Sales Insights Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an interactive **Retail Sales Insights Dashboard** using **Power BI** to analyze sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, and regional trends. The goal is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful, business-ready insights that support data-driven decision making.

The dashboard is designed with a clean layout, intuitive filters, and key performance indicators (KPIs) commonly used in retail analytics.

The data model follows a **star schema** with one-to-many relationships for efficient analysis.
